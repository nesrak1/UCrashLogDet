# UCrashLogDetector

Doing something wacky in the editor? Don't know what's going wrong? Figure out the function that's crashing with these three simple steps.

1. Build the project
2. Replace the Editor/BugReporter/unity.bugreporter.exe with the new UCrashLogDet.exe file
3. Crash the editor and look at the popup for the function it crashed on.
